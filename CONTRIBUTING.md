# Contributing to Compiler Explorer

First of, if you're reading this: thank you! Even considering contributing to
 **Compiler Explorer** is very much appreciated!
Before we go too far, an apology: **Compiler Explorer** grew out of a bit of
 hacky JavaScript into a pretty large and well-used project pretty quickly.
Not all the code was originally well-written or well-tested.
Please be forgiving of that, and be ready to help in improving that.

**Compiler Explorer** follows a [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) which
 aims to foster an open and welcoming environment.

This is a set of tools mainly for demangling code. Most of the interesting stuff is in
the [main repository](https://github.com/mattgodbolt/compiler-explorer).
